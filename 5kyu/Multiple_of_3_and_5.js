If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.

Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0.

Note: If a number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.*/

const solution=(n)=>n>0?Array.from({length: n}, (_,i)=>i).reduce((acc,el)=>(el%3===0 || el%5===0)?acc+el:acc,0):0
